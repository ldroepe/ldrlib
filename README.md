# ldrlib

A collection of utilities that I've thought would be useful at some point.
This repo is really just meant to serve as practice for writing (generic) C++ 
code & to hopefully learn some new concepts along the way.

## Included Work

### sets

An implementation of the set algorithms present in the STL for 
`std::unordered_set`.

## Future Work

- Implementing an iterator for a map, where the value type of said map is some 
sort of collection (e.g. `std::unordered_map<int, std::vector<std::string>>`)
